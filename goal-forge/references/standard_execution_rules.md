# Standard Execution Rules

Use these defaults in the `<execution_rules>` block when compiling `GOAL.md`, unless the repo or user requires a different rule.

- Check git status before edits.
- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Prefer `rg` over `grep` when available.
- Use the runtime's patch/edit tool for manual edits when available.
- Read context files before implementation.
- Batch independent file reads in parallel when the runtime supports it.
- Run focused tests before broad tests.
- Do not paper over failures.
- Do not widen scope.
- Keep the final answer concise.
