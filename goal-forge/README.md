# goal-forge

Codex skill that turns a rough coding idea into a Codex `/goal`-ready contract.

Pipeline: **rough idea → interviewed `SPEC.md` → tightened `SPEC.md` → `GOAL.md` → config readiness check**.

## Modes

- **Interview** — open-ended interview that forces decisions on scope, architecture, edge cases, verification. Hard gate: spec is not "done" until `done_when` has user-approved measurable criteria.
- **Tighten** — read `SPEC.md` skeptically; surface ambiguities with two interpretations + a recommendation.
- **Compile** — emit `GOAL.md` using the XML block structure in `references/goal_prompt_blocks.md`. Weak specs route back to Interview/Tighten.
- **Check config** — run `scripts/inspect_codex_config.py` for a read-only report on Codex version, project trust, and the full autonomous `/goal` config.

## Install

Drop the folder into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelpersonal/goal-forge.git ~/.codex/skills/goal-forge
```

Then invoke from Codex with `$goal-forge` or any of the natural-language triggers in `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter.

## Autonomous `/goal` config

For multi-hour autonomous `/goal` sessions, the skill checks `~/.codex/config.toml` against this target configuration:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
model_context_window = 1050000
model_auto_compact_token_limit = 997500
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"

[features]
goals = true
```

`model_reasoning_effort = "high"` is for execution work. `plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"` is for the planning pass. `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 997500` lets long sessions compact context before they hit the hard context limit.

Use `approval_policy = "never"` and `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` only in project paths you have explicitly marked trusted. They give the agent unsupervised filesystem access.

Run the inspector from a target project root:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/goal-forge/scripts/inspect_codex_config.py --project-path "$PWD"
```

The report prints `autonomous_goal_status: ready` only when the config, feature flag, Codex version, and project trust are aligned.

Inspired by [@ynkzlk](https://x.com/ynkzlk)'s blog post [*Codex /goal: A Six-Hour Run*](https://www.tectontide.com/en/blog/codex-goal-six-hour-run/), which makes the case that long-running `/goal` runs succeed or fail on upfront specification discipline — explicit measurable `done_when` criteria, XML-structured prompts, and context architecture (reading lists, working rules, anti-pattern fences) that keep the agent from taking shortcuts. This skill operationalizes that discipline as a repeatable pipeline.
